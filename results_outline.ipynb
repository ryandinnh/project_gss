    "            - Government supplied vaccines were still being mandated in some states in the America during the 2022 year. From the covid case numbers, they rose from 2021 but the deaths decreased which could explain how a majority of respondents still had some confidence in the us health care system and also thought that more government aid should be supplied.\n",
    "                - \"The number of cases for the months of January through June 2022 was about 2.4 times the number for the same period in 2021, and the number of COVID-attributed deaths likewise averaged 0.74 times the number in 2021\"\n",
    "    - Less confidence and less belief past the first point are unpopular, also indicating that extreme opinions on both opinions are unpopular. \n",
    "        -  When people believe that the government should play a more active role in healthcare, they also will likely expect higher standards of quality and affordability. If these expectations are not met, it can lead to decreased confidence in the healthcare system. (vice verse)\n",
